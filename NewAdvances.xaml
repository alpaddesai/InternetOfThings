Sensors are added to existing machinery without comprising the integrity.  The RFID energy autonomous sensors are available on the market and can be classified into two sets (i) low cost and qualitative analog tags (ii) medium cost electronic packed digital tags which permit an accurate and versatile sampling of physical parameters.
